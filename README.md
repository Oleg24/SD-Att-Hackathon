# SD-AT&T-Hackathon

This repo is for the project we created during the AT&T Hackathon May 30th - 31st.  

Our application is a subscription based service which allows users to sign up and track the codes they're interested in.  You can register with either your phone number or email and start receiving notifications whenever there's been updates to that case.
